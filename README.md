# Manim-Integral
The small project that I worked on during my time at university. The goal is only trying to do more projects relating to python
Basically, the project applies Manim (an animation engine for explanatory math videos) to animate integral
The main inspiration derives from the well known youtube channel 3Blue1Brown- more infos "https://www.3blue1brown.com/about"
